# Deep CNN Model for Image Classification
## Quick Start Guide to Building a Deep CNN Model

This repository provides a quick start guide to building a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can recognize two types of images, such as dogs and cats.

### Model Overview

The model is designed to classify images into two categories: dogs and cats. The CNN architecture is simple yet effective, making it a great starting point for beginners and experienced machine learning practitioners alike.

### Features

* Recognizes two types of images: dogs and cats
* Built using a deep CNN architecture
* Easy to train and deploy
* Ideal for beginners and experienced practitioners

### Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository and follow the instructions in the README file. You'll need to have Python and the required libraries installed on your machine.

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve the model or add new features, please submit a pull request.
