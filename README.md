# Deep CNN Model for Image Classification
## Quick Start Guide to Building a Deep CNN Model

This repository provides a quick start guide to building a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can recognize two types of images, such as dogs and cats.

### Model Overview

The model is designed to classify images into two categories: dogs and cats. The CNN architecture is simple yet effective, making it a great starting point for beginners and experienced machine learning practitioners alike.

To collect the data, I used the pinterest parser, where I simply entered "cats" and then "dogs". For tensorflow to recognize datasets correctly, for example, you need to create a folder "dataset" and in it create two folders - cats and dogs for example.

### Features

* Recognizes two types of images
* Built using a deep CNN architecture
* Easy to train and deploy
* Ideal for beginners and experienced practitioners

### Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository and follow the instructions in the README file. You'll need to have Python and the required libraries installed on your machine.
